# Telegram Bot APi access written in Rust

The goal of this Bot API is to stick as close as possible to the official Telegram Bot API (https://core.telegram.org/bots/api),
since other crates are pretty limited in their functions.

This project is WIP, but feel free to try it out and to report possible issues.

This telegram API can be used in a blocking fashion if you want to stay away from tokio/async/await issues.
